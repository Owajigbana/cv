    <h5 class="context">How did I get into web development?</h5>
    <p >I've been fascinated by the web and the dynamic
      interactions that have been made possible over the years. My journey
      into web development all began due a feature I came across on a dominos
      website; I was intrigued by the interaction section that appeared after
      an ordered was made, it gave me something to do while I waited for
      my order.

      As a result of my curiosity <strong>sometime in July 2018</strong>,
      I decided to search YouTube to find out how these features where
      created and there were so
      many videos to pick from, I was able to find a video that didn't use
      terms I was unfamiliar with but outlined the steps on how to start
      learning about the web and how it works. Through the video I realised
      the web was brought to life via more than one thing.
    </p>
    <div class="line"></div>
    <h5 class="context">My first steps into web development.</h5>
    <p>
      I started with HTML and CSS,I was able to grasp the concept of HTML quicker
      than expected, I added CSS to my studies, when I got to CSS I was mesmerised by the infinite
      possiblities that the animation and tranformation properties could give a website but I was more
      interested in website interaction, from one of the videos I came across in my studies
      I learnt you can use jQuery but I was unable to use jQuery as i struggled to understand
      what each line of code was doing so I backed up and started learning the
      fundamentals using JavaScript.Unlike HTML and CSS, JavaScript was quiet
      challenging as I had no prior programming background.
    </p>
    <div class="line"></div>
    <h5 class="context">Resources I used for studying.</h5>
    <p>
      I used 'watch and code' by Gordon Zhu to understand the application of
      JavaScript and I am still using 'The complete 2019 web development bootcamp'
      by Angela Yu as well as other resources such as: HTML, CSS, jQuery and
      JavaScript notes for professional; speaking JavaScript book and
      freecodeacademy; Modern JavaScript(from Novice to Ninja) by Shaun Pelling.
      I used these resources to learn whenever I could as I
      had a full-time job.<strong>Thanks to these resources,I have been able to
      create this portfolio to showcase what skills I've gained so far. </strong>
    </p>
    <div class="line"></div>
    <h5 class="context">What kept me going?</h5>
    <p>Despite coming across hard patches and especially being self-taught, finding
    the right materials to use can be exhausting at time.I kept with my studies because I
    love being able to solve a problem and making life easy for not just myself but others
    and being able to do so with programming kept me going. Knowing that I will never stop
    learning as programming languages are always evolving, various libraries are
    always being introduced also kept going. After a year of self-motivation and
    dedication <strong>I am now confident in HTML, CSS, bootstrap,JavaScript
    and jQuery,</strong></p>
    <div class="line"></div>
    <h5 class="context">My next steps into web development.</h5>
    <p>For my next, I would like to better understand the concepts of a server understand
    the use of databases. So, I will be going forward with my journey learning PHP and SQL.
